    <h2>About Alireza Sadeghi</h2>
    <p>
        Dr. Sadeghi was appointed an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at RPI in Fall 2023. His research revolves around the theme of collective intelligence. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, harnessing the power of data at the edge of the network has emerged as a pivotal catalyst for unlocking the true potential of collective intelligence. Dr. Amiri's research focuses on using this decentralized data to enhance the system intelligence beneficial for everyone while protecting the sensitive information.
        Hello and welcome to my website!
Hello and welcome to my website!
I am Alireza Sadeghi a Postdoctoral associate at the Electrical & Computer engineering department at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and a member of the Signal Processing in Networking and Communications (SPiNCOM) group under the supervision of Professor Georgios B. Giannakis.

My research interests involve Signal Processing, Statistical Learning, Machine Learning, and Optimization with their application in applications in designing reliable, scalable, and efficient cyber-physical systems including next-generation wireless and power networks.  Particularly I am interested in designing robust and scalable supervised, reinforce- ment, semi-supervised, and federated learning algorithms.

Specifically, I am currently working on Robust Meta-Learning, Self-supervised Learning, and Representation Learning with Weak supervision.
I am currently looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students interested in statistical signal processing and learning, weak supervision and crowdsourcing, and self-supervised learning. Please send me an email if you are interested!

Previously I was a Data-Scientist working in 3M Corporation.
