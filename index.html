    <h2>About Alireza Sadeghi</h2>
    Hello and welcome to my website!

    <p>
        Alireza Sadeghi is currently a research associate at the University of Minnesota's ECE department working in Signal Processing in Networking and Communication Group (SPiNCOM) under supervision of Prof. Georgios B. Giannakis. He holds B.Sc. degree (Hons.) from the Iran University of Science and Technology and an M.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Since 2016, he has been dedicated to pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota, with a research focus spanning machine learning, optimization, and signal processing in networking. His academic excellence is recognized through an ADC Fellowship and student travel awards from the IEEE Communications Society and the National Science Foundation.

In addition to academia, Alireza has played a pivotal role as a Data Scientist at 3M, leveraging GPT-2 Generative Model for Advanced Data Retention Strategies. His contributions include developing a DialoGPT model for doctor-patient dialogues and implementing Controlled Text Generation using BART-based summarization models. His commitment to transparency is evident in his work on Explainable Text Generation, where he designed methods to discern evidence for generated summaries, showcasing the integration of academic rigor and real-world impact.

Furthermore, Alireza made significant contributions during his internship at Microsoft Research, focusing on Data Science and Optimization for the energy grid. His research, working on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Optimization techniques to seamlessly integrate renewable energy into data center operations. His use of advanced methodologies, including dual decomposition and deep Q-network-based algorithms, aimed to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of data center functioning.
<!--        Dr. Sadeghi was appointed an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at RPI in Fall 2023. His research revolves around the theme of collective intelligence. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, harnessing the power of data at the edge of the network has emerged as a pivotal catalyst for unlocking the true potential of collective intelligence. Dr. Amiri's research focuses on using this decentralized data to enhance the system intelligence beneficial for everyone while protecting the sensitive information.-->
Hello and welcome to my website!
I am Alireza Sadeghi a Postdoctoral associate at the Electrical & Computer engineering department at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and a member of the Signal Processing in Networking and Communications (SPiNCOM) group under the supervision of Professor Georgios B. Giannakis.

My research interests involve Signal Processing, Statistical Learning, Machine Learning, and Optimization with their application in applications in designing reliable, scalable, and efficient cyber-physical systems including next-generation wireless and power networks.  Particularly I am interested in designing robust and scalable supervised, reinforce- ment, semi-supervised, and federated learning algorithms.

Specifically, I am currently working on Robust Meta-Learning, Self-supervised Learning, and Representation Learning with Weak supervision.
I am currently looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students interested in statistical signal processing and learning, weak supervision and crowdsourcing, and self-supervised learning. Please send me an email if you are interested!

Previously I was a Data-Scientist working in 3M Corporation.
