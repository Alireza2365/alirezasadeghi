        <h2 id="section3">About me!</h2>
        <p>
        Alireza Sadeghi is a Postdoctoral associate at the Electrical & Computer engineering department at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and a member of the Signal Processing in Networking and Communications (SPiNCOM) group under the supervision of Professor Georgios B. Giannakis.
        Alireza obtained his B.Sc. degree (with Honors) from the Iran University of Science and Technology in 2012, and M.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran in 2015, both in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
        In 2015 and before starting his PhD Alireza spent 6 month as a visiting scholar at the University of Padova, Padova, Italy working at the SIGnal processing and NETworking research group under supervision of Professor Michele Zorzi.
        Alireza obatined PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 2021. Before starting his role at the University of Minnesota as research associate, Alireza played a pivotal role as a full-time Data Scientist at 3M Corporation, where he was working on Natural Language Generation, Processing, and Inference using state-of-the-art NLP deep generative models such as BART, GPT-2, and BERT, among others.
        During the summer of 2021 Alireza spent a wonderful summer as an intern at Microsoft Research focusing on Data Science and Optimization for the energy grid.

        <h2>Research interests</h2>

        <p>
        My research involves Signal Processing, Statistical Learning, Machine Learning, and Optimization with their application in applications in designing reliable, scalable, and efficient cyber-physical systems including next-generation wireless and power networks.
        Particularly I am interested in designing robust and scalable supervised, reinforce- ment, semi-supervised, and federated learning algorithms.
        Specifically, I am currently working on Robust Meta-Learning, Self-supervised Learning, and Representation Learning with Weak supervision.
